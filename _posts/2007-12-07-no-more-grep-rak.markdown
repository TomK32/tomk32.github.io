I’m a big big fan for grep and sure couldn’t program without it. Especially if you are working in an existing project or software and don’t have a complete picture yet or the software is a confusing patchwork, grep is sometimes my only tool besides the editor. grepping in an rails app can be necessary too, sometimes, and with [rak](https://github.com/danlucraft/rak) there’s an alternative for the lazy among us. The only features over grep are highlighting the pattern and skipping the files/directories for version controlling.

_PS: Since then I moved on to `ack`_
