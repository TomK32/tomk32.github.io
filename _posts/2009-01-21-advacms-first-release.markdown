Itâ€™s been quite a while since I blogged about adva_cms here and in November I even joined the dev team. Just yesterday we finally [released the first version](http://adva-cms.org/2009/1/20/adva-cms-0-1-0-released) for the public and the next one coming soon with more features and fixes.

As I wrote in July and December adva_cms has grown from three applications using the [Engines](http://rails-engines.org/). And while I worked on the event calendar that principle turned out to work quite well. As did for the brand-new engines newsletter and photo album. So, check it out and let us know if you find any bugs :)
