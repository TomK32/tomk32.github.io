Itâ€™s fantastic to see the applications that I create in practice. [Naiku](http://naiku.net/) is a startup I work for since August and the company has made a [video of students](http://vimeo.com/20120477) using the app (both the web and mobile interface). Kudos to John and Peter who joined my developing efforts in the last months.
