title: popel - satirical open source
---

I'm a Linux user and since some early Debian and SUSE versions in the late 90s, went Mac for a decade before returning in 2015 and I don't regret that.
A few months ago a friend show me `sl`, a satirical piece of software for those typing `ls` wrong too often. My two-year-old also loves sl, so watch the youtube video if you don't have a linux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPMd2dsSVR0

Then another friend showed me [`gti`](https://github.com/rwos/gti), vital for [`git`]({{ 'git' | tag_url}}) users. That friend isn't a fan of the VW GTI like myself so he created an [Opel
variation](https://github.com/DevLoL/gti/commit/273e4cbe5e962a68cf6989ce1cf951fc355ad183) which of course was rejected by the good developer of gti. I mean Opel doesn't even look like git.

But do not despiar, this is open source after all and there's a piece of software with opel in it's name: [sopel](https://sopel.chat/) a python IRC but and I created and cleaned up the Opel code aptly
named [Popel](https://github.com/TomK32/popel).

It doesn't have to be a big editor or desktop manager, every open source software and adapt and be born as something new.
