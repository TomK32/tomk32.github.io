There's an anoying mechanical problem with a few cameras like my Olympus PEN E-PL5 which results in a shutter stuck when trying to take a photo. Someone even made a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP0Imk14yQw), and [others](https://www.flickr.com/groups/2139817@N23/discuss/72157646093507478/) report the same issue too.
The camera's film function works as expected.

The camera has to shutter curtains according to [this comment on mikrocontroller.net](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/443826#5292973) and while the first one works without a hitch,
the other one is the one prune to get stuck.

## My solution

So, once you are sure the problem description fits and you can safely assume it's a mechanical problem, then I have a solution for you.
It requires applying some force. You get yourself a decent sized book and place it on the table, the book is what you'll slam the camera onto.

Best to do this without a lense installed.

First start the camera, set a long exposure time, click the button and then slam the camera on the book.
You might have to repeat this a few times or slam it on a different side.

I had the issue twice and that's how I solved it both times.

If it worked for you, please do send me a mail and let me know.

*Update 2019-03-26:* It happened again, but a 5s exposure and and whack on the knee loosened the shutter.
