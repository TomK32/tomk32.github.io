Over the last months the speakers of my Thinkpadx X240 got worse and worse. Sure, half-broken bottom case with screws missing didn't help but the sound was just awful when turned up to 11.

So when I finally replaced that bottom case (â‚¬30 well spent) I finally had a look into the speaker issue and had the idea it might be just dirty. Luckily I tried to clean it with my somewhat magnetic
screwdriver and small bits of metal unstuck from the speaker and stuck to the screwdriver. Yay.
A few minutes the two speakers were all nice and clean again and the sound just perfect once more.

Below are pictures from before and after.
