%h2
  %a{href: 'http://naiku.net'} Naiku
  %small.meta (since 2010, ruby-on-rails, nodejs)
%p Delivered the prototype for their assessment platform and kept on going. Not a unicorn but a solid success with interesting aspects like a short peaks during the school day.
%h2
  garmz
  %small.meta (early 2010, ruby-on-rails)
%p A now folded startup in the fashion business. The first client I've delivered a mongodb backend for which sadly got replaced when I left after the initial phase in Vienna before they moved to London.
%h2
  m-otion.at
  %small.meta (2009, web development)
%p Not a ruby job, but none-the-less interesting it was to work in a conglomerate of companies from high-level web development over webdesign to advertising and magazine editorials. My work revolved around a webmail and SMS application for TelCos.
%h2
  lomography community website
  %small.meta (summer 2009, ruby-on-rails)
%p Vienna is certainly a vibrant city and the three months with the lomo team are something to remember. I did misc tasks, from getting the performance up (2008 ruby meant regular restarts for the leaking app processes!) to new features.
%h2
  touchlocal.co.uk
  %small.meta (early 2008, ruby-on-rails)
%p Working on the Albert Embankment next to the iconic MI6 building and watching the sun set between the towers of Battersea power station makes you almost think that coding for a large business directory is work. The first weeks I got the test suite back running again.
%h2
  nikt.at
  %small.meta (2007)
%p Advertising agency with a web design department. My first contact with AJAX
%h2
  subnet
  %small.meta (2007)
%p One of those small culture support organisations that popped up in the 90s. Worked on various projects, including a first Rails app that turned into a complete failure.
