{:.intro}
  This is an list of companies and clients I worked for. You are invited to join them,
  [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you have an idea and the funds to realize it. I do offer reasonable rates for prototypes
  and I'm open to low rates if some equity is part of it.

## [Naiku](https://naiku.net) <small class="meta">(since 2010, Ruby On Rails, nodejs)</small>
Delivered the prototype for their assessment platform and kept on going. Not a unicorn but a solid success with interesting aspects like a short peaks during the school day.

## [A Song a Day](https://www.asongaday.co/) <small class="meta">(2017, Ruby On Rails)</small>
A small project for music lovers (like myself) that needed some TLC after being dormant for some months.

## [Bittex](http://portal.bittex.at) <small class="meta">(2017, Ruby On Rails)</small>
A 24hr rescue mission after the original developer went AWOL. Besides moving/restoring everything from backup to a new server I improved a few things.

## [Ahima reports](https://www.ahimareports.com) <small class="meta">(2016, Ruby On Rails)</small>
A small side-project with the Naiku team. Generate reports (both HTML and PDF) from student results.

## Schoolcamp <small class="meta">(2010, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Basically Basecamp for schools, sadly the project got scrapped after the initial testing phase.

## garmz <small class="meta">early 2010, Ruby On Rails</small>
A now folded startup in the fashion business. The first client I've delivered a mongodb backend for which sadly got replaced when I left after the initial phase in Vienna before they moved to London.

## m-otion.at <small class="meta">(2009, web development)</small>
Not a ruby job, but none-the-less interesting it was to work in a conglomerate of companies from high-level web development over webdesign to advertising and magazine editorials. My work revolved around a webmail and SMS application for TelCos.

## adva-cma <small class="meta">(2009)</small>
An early Ruby on Rails framework I did develop various features for

## opntables <small class="meta">(2009, Ruby on Rails)</small>
Aggregator, offline nowadays but the [code](https://github.com/kohlhofer/open-tables) still lives on github

## [lomography community website](https://www.lomography.com/homes) <small class="meta">(summer 2008, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Vienna is certainly a vibrant city and the three months with the lomo team are something to remember. I did misc tasks, from getting the performance up (2008 ruby/apache meant regular restarts for the leaking app processes!) to new features.

## touchlocal.co.uk <small class="meta">(early 2008, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Working on the Albert Embankment next to the iconic MI6 building and watching the sun set between the towers of Battersea power station makes you almost think that coding for a large business directory is work. The first weeks I got the test suite back running again.

## nikt.at <small class="meta">(2007)</small>
Advertising agency with a web design department. My first contact with AJAX

## subnet <small class="meta">(2007)</small>
One of those small culture support organisations that popped up in the 90s. Worked on various projects, including a first Rails app that turned into a complete failure.

## personal projects

* Before I knew what a blog was I wrote a blogging software in PHP, hello 2001: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysecretdiary/
* plasticairships was one of my more mature rails projects in 2008 https://github.com/TomK32/plasticairships
* You think 4ormat but I remember [photostre.am](https://github.com/TomK32/photostre.am) which I created back in 2008 to aggregate my flickr photos into a nice looking website
