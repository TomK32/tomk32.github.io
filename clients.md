{:.intro}
  This is an list of companies and clients I worked for. You are invited to join them,
  [contact me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) if you have an idea and the funds to realize it. I do offer reasonable rates for prototypes
  and I'm open to low rates if some equity is part of it.

## [Naiku](http://naiku.net) <small class="meta">(since 2010, Ruby On Rails, nodejs)</small>
Delivered the prototype for their assessment platform and kept on going. Not a unicorn but a solid success with interesting aspects like a short peaks during the school day.

## Schoolcamp <small class="meta">(2010, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Basically Basecamp for schools, sadly the project got scrapped after the initial testing phase.

## garmz <small class="meta">early 2010, Ruby On Rails</small>
A now folded startup in the fashion business. The first client I've delivered a mongodb backend for which sadly got replaced when I left after the initial phase in Vienna before they moved to London.

## m-otion.at <small class="meta">(2009, web development)</small>
Not a ruby job, but none-the-less interesting it was to work in a conglomerate of companies from high-level web development over webdesign to advertising and magazine editorials. My work revolved around a webmail and SMS application for TelCos.

## lomography community website <small class="meta">(summer 2009, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Vienna is certainly a vibrant city and the three months with the lomo team are something to remember. I did misc tasks, from getting the performance up (2008 ruby meant regular restarts for the leaking app processes!) to new features.

## touchlocal.co.uk <small class="meta">(early 2008, Ruby On Rails)</small>
Working on the Albert Embankment next to the iconic MI6 building and watching the sun set between the towers of Battersea power station makes you almost think that coding for a large business directory is work. The first weeks I got the test suite back running again.

## nikt.at <small class="meta">(2007)</small>
Advertising agency with a web design department. My first contact with AJAX

## subnet <small class="meta">(2007)</small>
One of those small culture support organisations that popped up in the 90s. Worked on various projects, including a first Rails app that turned into a complete failure.
