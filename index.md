My first steps into webdevlopment were back in 2001, focusing on building and maintaining applications, In 2001 I started programming in PHP, released a simple text-file based blog-software (it's still on sourceforge) before moving on to Ruby on Rails in 2007. This is now my main focus, sprinkled in with databases, front-end and server admin.
