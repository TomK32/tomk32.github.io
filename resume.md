Born in 1982 in the Berchtesgaden, studied at University of Salzburg before professional work drew me in. In those years I was an active Wikipedia admin, published a bi-weekly PDF magazine. I started programming still in school in the late 90ies, enjoyed writing small websites in PHP before moving on to Ruby on Rails and larger web applications.

Besides work I enjoy programming small video games, making electronics projects (arduino, ESP8266, IoT, etc), photography, anything related to [bicycles](https://www.instagram.com/toms_cycling_stuff), [crochet](https://haekeln.tomk32.de), and some sailing. In 2015 life changed a lot with the birth of my daughter.

To learn more about my previous work and projects, have a look at my [clients]({{ 'clients' | relative_url }}).

If you are interested in me working for you, I have a wide range of private projects, from web-apps to mobile games and some dating back to 2001,
of which I'm willing to share the codebase in confidiality. This should allow you to get a good impression of my work and style.
