Born in 1982 in the Bavaria alps, studied at University of Salzburg before professional work drew me in. In those years I was an active Wikipedia admin, published a bi-weekly PDF magazine and many more things. I started programming in the last 90ies, enjoyed writing small websites in PHP before moving on to Ruby on Rails and larger web applications.

Besides work I enjoy programming small video games, making electronics projects (arduino, EPS8266, IoT, etc), photography and recently started sailing. In 2015 life changed with our first child.

To learn more about my previous work and projects, have a look at my [clients]({{ 'clients' | relative_url }}).
